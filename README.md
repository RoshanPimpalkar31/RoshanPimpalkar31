### About me
I’m Roshan Pimpalkar, a DevOps Engineer with ~4 years of experience designing and operating cloud-native infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and GitOps-based delivery flows. I focus on reliability, automation, and developer experience to help teams ship faster and safer.

- 🔭 Currently building and automating production-grade infrastructure and deployment pipelines.
- 🌱 Continuously improving platform observability, cost optimization, and cluster reliability.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love turning manual runbooks into automated, testable pipelines.

---

### Core Skills
- Cloud: AWS, Azure  
- Container orchestration & runtimes: Kubernetes, Docker  
- GitOps & deployment tools: Argo CD, Helm (Helm + GitOps)  
- Cluster management: Rancher  
- CI/CD & automation: GitLab CI, Jenkins  
- IaC & platform automation: (add tools you use: Terraform / CloudFormation / ARM if applicable)

---

### Typical work
- Design and operate highly available Kubernetes clusters across cloud providers.
- Implement GitOps workflows (Argo CD + Helm) for repeatable deployments.
- Build CI/CD pipelines (GitLab CI / Jenkins) with automated testing and promotion.
- Manage cloud resources (AWS/Azure) with a focus on cost, security, and scalability.
- Set up observability, alerting, and runbooks to reduce incident MTTR.

### What I’m looking for
Open to opportunities where I can contribute to platform reliability, automation, and developer productivity. (Please tell me whether you want this shown publicly as Open / Maybe / Not looking.)
